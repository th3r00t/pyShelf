  The Open Publication Distribution System (OPDS) Catalog format is a syndication
  format for electronic publications based on Atom and HTTP. OPDS Catalogs enable
  the aggregation, distribution, discovery, and acquisition of electronic
  publications. OPDS Catalogs use existing or emergent open standards and
  conventions, with a priority on simplicity.
