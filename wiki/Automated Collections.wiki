= Automated Collection Management System =
The collection management system needs rewritten from the ground up.
The model should look something like this.
* [ ] TODO :: Refactor collections algorithm.  #8f46262c
{{{python
  Collection {
    id: int
    name: String
    books: list(Book)
  }
}}}

it is likely the book object will need rewritten as well.
{{{python
  Book {
    id: int
    title: String
    # other book metadata
    collection: list(Collection.id)
  }
}}}
